#Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

transport = ['car', 'train', 'airplane']
print(f"I would love to own a Tesla {transport[0]}.")
print(f"I love {transport[1]}s because they are so cool!")
print(f"{transport[2].title()}s are so fasttttt.")
