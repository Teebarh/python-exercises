# An administrator is a special kind of user. Write a class called
# Admin that inherits from the User class you wrote in Exercise 9-3 (page 162)
# or Exercise 9-5 (page 167). Add an attribute, privileges, that stores a list
# of strings like "can add post", "can delete post", "can ban user", and so on.
# Write a method called show_privileges() that lists the administratorâ€™s set of
# privileges. Create an instance of Admin, and call your method.
